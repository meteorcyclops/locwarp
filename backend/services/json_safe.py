"""Safe JSON persistence helpers shared by every ``~/.locwarp`` data file
(bookmarks, routes, recent places, settings).

Two invariants both helpers enforce:

* **Never silently discard user data on a load failure.** The previous
  per-file pattern — ``try: read; except: return empty`` — meant any
  transient corruption or schema mismatch made the in-memory state go
  empty; the next write then overwrote the original file with that
  empty state, destroying the user's data for good. These helpers copy
  the corrupt file aside to ``<file>.bak-<timestamp>`` before handing
  the caller an empty result, so the original bytes are always
  recoverable.
* **Every write is atomic.** We serialise to a sibling ``.tmp`` file and
  then ``Path.replace`` it over the target. A crash / power loss / OS
  kill in the middle of the write leaves the original file untouched
  instead of truncated.

Callers import and use ``safe_load_json`` / ``safe_write_json`` directly
so every .locwarp JSON file gets the same protection, not just the one
that already surfaced a data-loss report.
